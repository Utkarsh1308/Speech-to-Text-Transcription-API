As the Titanic sank, another ship, believed to have been the Californian, was 
seen motionless less than twenty miles away. The ship failed to respond to 
the Titanicâ€™s eight distress rockets. Although the officers of the 
Californian tried to signal the Titanic with their flashing Morse lamp, they 
did not wake up their radio operator to listen for a distress call. At this 
time, communication at sea through wireless was new and the benefits not well 
appreciated, so the wireless on ships was often not operated around the 
clock. In the case of the Californian, the wireless operator slept unaware 
while 1,500 Titanic passengers and crew drowned only a few miles away.
